Objective:
Demonstrate a creative and interactive use of the setState() method in Flutter to update the UI dynamically.
This assignment is meant to strengthen your understanding of stateful widgets and how to rebuild the UI using setState() in a meaningful and fun way.
Task: Build an Interactive Counter with a Twist
Create a counter app — but make it creative. Add any one of the following twists:
🔹 Choose one or more of these ideas:
Color Change Counter
 Every time the user presses the increment button, the background color of the app or container changes randomly.
Emoji Mood Counter
 Based on the counter value, show different emojis (e.g., 😐, 🙂, 😄, 🤩) using Text and update them with setState().
Shape Switcher
 Instead of just counting, every tap changes the shape of a Container (circle ↔ square ↔ rounded box).
Font Size Grower
 Increase/decrease the size of text every time the button is pressed.
Multi-Button Toggle
 Add multiple buttons to update different parts of the UI — like changing a quote, image, or color.
You’re free to combine or create your own creative use case of setState()!
